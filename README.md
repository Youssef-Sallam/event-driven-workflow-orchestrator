# event-driven-workflow-orchestrator

This project implements a scalable, event-driven workflow orchestrator using Python for the backend. The system is designed for post-flash sale operations: it ingests order events, reconciles them via mock in-house order service, checks/triggers inventory restocking via mock inventory service, and alerts on low inventory.

## Design Choices

- **Scalability**: Asyncio + Redis handles 1000+ events/min (tested: pytest includes load test).
- **No PII**: Logger filters demonstrated in tests.
- **Extension**: Add nodes in main.py _process_step; templates in YAML.
- **Configuration**: Env vars for Redis URL, thresholds in stubs.

## Usage Guide

1. Desing workflow in /designer.
2. Export/import templates.
3. Simulate: Run script.
4. Monitor in /dashboard.
5. View logs: tail -f logs/app.log (setup in logger).
